# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository serves as the foundation for understanding and implementing Requirement Analysis in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). 
It contains resources, documentation, and use case diagrams to assist in the analysis and documentation of requirements for a booking management system.
## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of gathering and defining the requirements for a software system. 
It involves understanding the needs of the stakeholders, determining system functionalities, and ensuring that the system aligns with business goals. This phase is critical in the SDLC as it sets the foundation for all subsequent development activities.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. **Clear Understanding of System Requirements:** Helps in identifying all system requirements early, avoiding misunderstandings later in development.
2. **Prevents Scope Creep:** Ensures that project scope is defined and prevents uncontrolled changes during development.
3. **Aligns Stakeholder Expectations:** Helps stakeholders define and agree on system requirements, ensuring the final product meets their needs.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- **Requirement Gathering:** Collecting the initial information from stakeholders to understand the needs of the system.
- **Requirement Elicitation:** Techniques like interviews, surveys, and workshops to extract detailed information from stakeholders.
- **Requirement Documentation:** Writing detailed specifications of functional and non-functional requirements.
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:** Analyzing requirements and representing them visually, such as through use case diagrams or flowcharts.
- **Requirement Validation:** Ensuring that the gathered and documented requirements align with stakeholder expectations and business goals.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
Functional requirements define the specific functions and features of the system. For the booking management system, an example could be:
- **User Registration**: Users should be able to register for an account with personal details.

### Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements define how the system should perform. For the booking management system, an example could be:
- **Performance**: The system should handle at least 1000 simultaneous bookings without crashing.

## Use Case Diagrams

Use case diagrams help visualize the interactions between users (actors) and the system. They highlight key system functionalities and their relations to different users.

## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance criteria define the conditions a feature must meet to be considered complete. It ensures that the feature satisfies the stakeholder requirements.

### Example for Checkout Feature:
- The checkout process should allow users to enter payment details.
- Payment processing should be completed within 3 minutes.
- A confirmation email should be sent to the user after successful payment.
